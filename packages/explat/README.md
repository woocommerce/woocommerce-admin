## Installation

Install the module

## Usage

```js
import { Experiment } from '@woocommerce/explat';

const DefaultExperience = <div>Hello World</div>;

const TreatmentExperience = <div>Hello WooCommerce!</div>;

const LoadingExperience = <div>‚è∞</div>;

<Experiment
	name="woocommerce_example_experiment"
	defaultExperience={ DefaultExperience }
	treatmentExperience={ TreatmentExperience }
	loadingExperience={ LoadingExperience }
/>;
```
