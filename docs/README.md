# WooCommerce Admin

This is a feature plugin for a modern, javascript-driven WooCommerce Admin experience.

## Prerequisites

[WordPress 5.4 or greater](https://wordpress.org/download/) and [WooCommerce 4.8.0 or greater](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) should be installed prior to activating the WooCommerce Admin feature plugin.

For better debugging, it's also recommended you add `define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );` to your wp-config. This will load the unminified version of all libraries, and specifically the development build of React.

## Development

After cloning the repo, install dependencies:

-   `pnpm install` to install JavaScript dependencies.
-   `composer install` to gather PHP dependencies.

Now you can build the files using one of these commands:

-   `pnpm run build` : Build a production version
-   `pnpm run dev` : Build a development version
-   `pnpm start` : Build a development version, watch files for changes
-   `pnpm run build:release` : Build a WordPress plugin ZIP file (`woocommerce-admin.zip` will be created in the repository root)

## Privacy

If you have enabled WooCommerce usage tracking ( option `woocommerce_allow_tracking` ) then, in addition to the tracking described in https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/, this plugin also sends information about the actions that site administrators perform to Automattic - see https://automattic.com/privacy/#information-we-collect-automatically for more information.
